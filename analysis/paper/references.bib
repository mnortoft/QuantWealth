  abstract = {The international Archaeological Conference of Central Germany 2018, hosted annually by the State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology Saxony-Anhalt, was devoted to the topic of \guillemotright Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Settlement Archaeology\guillemotleft. The aim is to bring up to date the state of research in the field of settlement archaeology during the 3rd and first half of the 2nd millennium BCE. Especially in the new federal states of Germany large-scale archaeological remains of settlements have been revealed, as various major infrastructural projects and the construction of business parks were carried out since the German reunification. Until today, the total extent of these settlement sites are hard to grasp. Starting point are the distribution area of the Central German Unetice Culture, its predecessors, as well as the culturally closely connected regions. However, new insights into social change, mobility, and intensification of long-distance contacts in the 3rd and 2nd millennium BC require a broadening of the perspective onto the whole of Europe. The present conference proceedings span from the Carpathian to Ireland and from Denmark to Sicily, thus laying the foundation for a settlement archaeology which is not tied to today's political boundaries.},

  abstract = {The Bronze Age of Eurasia (around 3000\textendash 1000 BC) was a period of major cultural changes. However, there is debate about whether these changes resulted from the circulation of ideas or from human migrations, potentially also facilitating the spread of languages and certain phenotypic traits. We investigated this by using new, improved methods to sequence low-coverage genomes from 101 ancient humans from across Eurasia. We show that the Bronze Age was a highly dynamic period involving large-scale population migrations and replacements, responsible for shaping major parts of present-day demographic structure in both Europe and Asia. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesized spread of Indo-European languages during the Early Bronze Age. We also demonstrate that light skin pigmentation in Europeans was already present at high frequency in the Bronze Age, but not lactose tolerance, indicating a more recent onset of positive selection on lactose tolerance than previously thought.},

The authors provide a global range of case studies from both New and Old World archaeology--a royal Aztec dog burial, the monumental horse tombs of Central Asia, and the ceremonial macaw cages of ancient Mexico among them. They explore the complex relationships between people and animals in social, economic, political, and ritual contexts, incorporating animal remains from archaeological sites with artifacts, texts, and iconography to develop their interpretations. Animals and Inequality in the Ancient World presents new data and interpretations that reveal the role of animals, their products, and their symbolism in structuring social inequalities in the ancient world. The volume will be of interest to archaeologists, especially zooarchaeologists, and classical scholars of pre-modern civilizations and societies"--},

Der Transport von Lasten und Menschen kann als einer der wichtigsten Eckpfeiler solcher Austauschsysteme gesehen werden. Daher d\"urften die Suche nach Transportm\"oglichkeiten und die Entwicklung geeigneter Vehikel in der menschlichen Gedankenwelt seit jeher fest verankert sein. Die hier vorliegenden Beitr\"age basieren auf den Vortr\"agen der Tagung ,,Transporte, Transportwege und Transportstrukturen`` der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Bronzezeit und des Sonderforschungsbereiches 1070 RessourcenKulturen. Sie fassen im arch\"aologischen Befund der Bronzezeit vorhandene Evidenzen zu Transportwegen und -fahrzeugen sowie Aussagen zu Infrastruktur nicht nur zusammen, sondern erg\"anzen diese um zahlreiche wissenswerte Aspekte. Was k\"onnen diese Befunde \"uber die Transportvehikel und ihre Bedeutung aussagen? Welche Eigenschaften wiesen diese auf? Handelt es sich bei den Fundst\"ucken um abgenutzte oder mutwillig zerst\"orte Fahrzeuge bzw. Teile von solchen? Welche Implikationen auf technologischer und sozialer Ebene lassen sich mit den Befunden verbinden? Wie muss man sich die bronzezeitliche Infrastruktur in unterschiedlichen Regionen vorstellen? Inwiefern bildeten Verkehrswege und Austausch eine Ressource? Der detaillierten Beantwortung dieser Fragen ist dieser Band gewidmet, woraus eine \"ubergreifende Zusammenschau von Funden, Befunden und Theorien entstanden ist.},

  abstract = {The explanations of burial customs provided by previous anthropologists are examined at length together with the assumptions and data orientations that lay behind them. Both the assumptions and explanations are shown to be inadequate from the point of view of systems theory and from a detailed examination of the empirical record. A cross-cultural survey drawn from the Human Relations Area Files shows that associations do exist between measures of mortuary ritual variety and structural complexity. It was found that both the number and specific forms of the dimensions of the social persona commonly recognized in mortuary ritual vary significantly with the organizational complexity of the society as measured by different forms of subsisence practice. Moreover, the forms that differentiations in mortuary ritual take vary significantly with the dimensions of the social persona symbolized. Hence, much of contemporary archaeological conjecture and interpretation regarding processes of cultural change, cultural differentiation, and the presence of specific burial customs is inadequate as well as the ideational propositions and assumptions underlying these notions. Inferences about the presumed "relationships" compared directly from trait lists obtaining among archaeological manifestations are useless without knowledge of the organizational properties of the pertinent cultural systems.}

  abstract = {Purpose is to identify process engineering of mining under the Late Bronze age (18th-13th centuries BCE) in the context of copper deposits in the Eastern Ukraine. Among other things, it concerns analysis of manufacturing artifacts (i.e. ore production and preparation) in Kartamysh archeological area within the copper-ore territory of Bakhmut basin of Donbas.        Methods. Following methods have been applied: a comparative historical method supported by typological archaeological approach; statistical procedures; engineering and geological methods to determine extraction volumes and evaluate copper ore extraction from the mines in Kartamysh archaeological area as well as structural and technologic analysis; functional and typological analysis; traceological analysis; experimental modelling; and carbon dating.        Findings. Analysis of the specialized mining artifacts in Kartamysh archaeological area as well as mining artifacts within other copper-ore deposits in Bakhmut basin, extracted actively under the Late Bronze age, has made it possible to consider newly a number of important issues connected with process engineering of mining, specialization and labour division of ancient miners as well as evaluate significance of Donbas copper mines for the system of metal production development in the Eastern Europe of the second millennium BCE.        Originality.Analysis of Kartamysh archaeological area, where the majority of business performance objects are connected with mining, has helped the authors consider specialization of the industrial systems (i.e. different-purpose mine workings, various mining tools, and areas to prepare ore) right from the viewpoint of the production method. Since similar situation is typical for other Donets complex artifacts, being involved in scientific terminology as the mining and smelting one, it would be more reasonable to represent it as Donets ore mining system owing to its specialization in the integrated copper ore extraction and preparation.        Practical implications.The research results develop the history of mining science and engineering inclusive of ancient mining history in the Eastern Ukraine. They may be applied to train mining experts and in the process of creation of museum exhibitions (looking ahead, creation of Kartamysh skansen) while synthesizing technical and humanitarian aspects of engineering activities.}

  abstract = {Testing Protocols Using `Fire' to Quarry Toolstones Recent experiments conducted in January and August of 2018 in the Cheshire formation of the Green Mountains, Vermont were inspired by recent research in Central Quebec, Canada at Colline Blanche. At Colline Blanche, ancient quarrying behaviors suggested agencies related to thermal spalling extraction techniques and mining using controlled fire, ostensibly during cold conditions. The Vermont location was selected as a `proxy' to test ``fire spalling'' because Colline Blanche is held sacred and protected by First Nations aegis. Both locations in Canada and Vermont were also known as prehistoric sources of lithic toolstones. Each was also affected by `cold' climate regimes and contained toolstones of highly siliceous (SiO2) materials; Mistassini quartzite in the former and Cheshire quartzite in the latter. The Vermont experiments tested two separate locations, each with similar quarrying protocols, ie. Experiments were conducted on free standing blocks and on situ outcrop faces. The Vermont locus was also tested during more temperate conditions to compare cold and warm firing episodes. Eleven experiments were designed and carried out. The implications and results of these experiments will be presented.},

In light of the recent evidence that farming was introduced at this time by large-scale immigration from northwest Europe, and that expansion within Britain was extremely rapid, we argue that this synchronicity supports this speed of colonization and reflects a knowledge of complex extraction processes and associated exchange networks already possessed by the immigrant groups; long-range connections developed as colonization rapidly expanded. Although we can model the start of these new extraction activities, it remains difficult to estimate how long significant production activity lasted at these key sites given the nature of the record from which samples could be obtained.},

Rigorously dated prehistoric sites in the upper Mun Valley of Northeast Thailand have revealed a 12-phase sequence beginning with the first farmers followed by the adoption of bronze and then iron metallurgy leading on to the rise of early states. On the basis of the burial rituals involving interment with a wide range of mortuary offerings and associated practices, we identify, by computing the values of the Gini coefficient, at least two periods of intensified social inequality. The first occurred during the initial Bronze Age that, we suggest, reflected restricted elite ownership of exotic valuables within an exchange choke point. The second occurred during the later Iron Age when increased aridity stimulated an agricultural revolution that rapidly led to the first state societies in mainland Southeast Asia.},

  abstract = {`Corded Ware' in central and eastern Europe is an archaeological phenomenon that has generated multiple ideas and myths about the origins of the Indo-European language, large scale migrations from the eastern Steppes and radical ideological turnovers after 3000               bc               . These ideas have been fostered in large part by the over-emphasis placed by successive generations of archaeologists on its extraordinarily large geographical extent and on the seemingly uniform pattern of Corded Ware material culture. The traditional model is characterised by the presence of an early phase, the so-called A-horizon, showing pan-European unity in material culture, and a successive phase characterised by increasing regional variability. However, over the last 15 years, a number of new studies, especially those focusing on the rigorous radiocarbon dating of Corded Ware contexts, bring into question several of the fundamental aspects of this old model. New results strongly suggest that the different components of the Corded Ware A-horizon emerged in several different regions, and that the previously claimed cultural uniformity is instead due to the co-occurrence of some special elements, while regional variability stands out as being much more prominent than hitherto assumed throughout all Corded Ware phases. Here, a new interpretation built on the diversity and regional variability of material culture and burial practices is proposed, one that challenges the view of Corded Ware as an expression of a social totality. This new model argues that several interlinked networks facilitated the flow of new practices and symbols into very diverse regional settings. Rather than viewing the Corded Ware phenomenon as representing a singular identity, ideology, or tradition, it may be more appropriate to regard it as a set of symbols and practices that were selectively incorporated into, and transformed by, local societies; it is this which produced the diversity attested for in the archaeological record                        ,              R\'ESUM\'E                            `Mise sens dessus-dessous d'une totalit\'e': R\'e\'evaluation de la variabilit\'e de la c\'eramique cord\'ee dans l'Europe du N\'eolithque final               , de Martin Furholt                          `La c\'eramique cord\'ee' en Europe centrale et orientale est un ph\'enom\`ene arch\'eologique qui a g\'en\'er\'e de multiples id\'ees et mythes sur les origines de la langue indo-europ\'eenne, des migrations \`a grande \'echelle venues des steppes orientales et des retournements id\'eologiques radicaux apr\`es 3000 av. J.-C. Ces id\'ees ont en grande partie \'et\'e entretenues par l'emphase excessive plac\'ee par des g\'en\'erations successives d'arch\'eologues sur son \'etendue g\'eographique extraordinairement vaste et sur lea configuration apparemment uniforme de la culture mat\'erielle de la poterie cord\'ee. Le mod\`ele traditionnel se caract\'erise par la pr\'esence d'une phase initiale, le soi-disant horizon A, montrant l'unit\'e pan-europ\'eenne de la culture mat\'erielle, et une phase successive caract\'eris\'ee par l'augmentation de la variabilit\'e r\'egionale. Cependant, au cours des quinze derni\`eres ann\'ees, un nombre de nouvelles \'etudes, en particulier celles se concentrant sur la rigoureuse datation au radiocarbone des contextes de la c\'eramique cord\'ee remettent en question plusieurs des aspects fondamentaux de ce vieux mod\`ele. De nouveaux r\'esultats donnent fortement \`a penser que les divers composants de l'horizon A de la c\'eramique cord\'ee sont ont \'emerg\'e dans plusieurs r\'egions diff\'erentes et que l'uniformit\'e culturelle revendiqu\'ee pr\'ec\'edemment est au contraire due \`a la simultan\'e\"it\'e de certains \'el\'ements sp\'eciaux, tandis que la variabilit\'e r\'egionale ressort comme \'etant beaucoup plus pro\'eminente qu'on ne l'avait suppos\'e auparavant pendant toutes les phases de la c\'eramique cord\'ee. On propose ici une nouvelle interpr\'etation b\^atie sur la diversit\'e et la variabilit\'e r\'egionales de la culture mat\'erielle et des pratiques fun\'eraires, interpr\'etation qui d\'efie la vision de la poterie cord\'ee comme expression d'une totalit\'e sociale. Ce nouveau mod\`ele argumente que plusieurs r\'eseaux interconnect\'es ont facilit\'e le flux de nouvelles pratiques et de nouveaux symboles parmi des groupes r\'egionaux tr\`es divers. Plut\^ot que d'envisager le ph\'enom\`ene de la c\'eramique cord\'ee comme la repr\'esentation d'une identit\'e, id\'eologie ou tradition unique, il serait peut-\^etre plus appropri\'e de le consid\'erer comme un ensemble de symboles et de pratiques qui furent s\'electivement incorpor\'ees dans, et transform\'ees par des soci\'et\'es locales, c'est ceci qui a produit la diversit\'e attest\'ee dans les vestiges arch\'eologiques           ,              ZUMMANENFASSUNG                            Eine ,,Totalit\"at`` kippen: Eine Neubewertung der Variabilit\"at innerhalb der Schnurkeramik im sp\"atneolithischen Europa               , von Martin Furholt                                         Die sogenannte ,,Schnurkeramische Kultur`` in Mittel- und Osteuropa ist ein arch\"aologisches Ph\"anomen, das eine Vielzahl von Ideen und Mythen hervorbrachte \"uber den Ursprung der indo-europ\"aischen Sprache, \"uber gro\ss r\"aumige Migrationen aus der \"ostlichen Steppe und \"uber radikale ideologische Umbr\"uche in Europa nach 3000               bc               . Diese Vorstellungen wurden zum gro\ss en Teil durch die \"Uberbetonung gef\"ordert, die mehrere Generationen von Arch\"aologen auf die ungew\"ohnlich gro\ss e r\"aumliche Ausdehnung und die scheinbar einheitliche materielle Kultur der Schnurkeramik legten. Das traditionelle Modell dieser arch\"aologischen Kultur wird durch die Pr\"asenz einer Fr\"uhphase charakterisiert, den sogenannten A-Horizont, der eine gesamteurop\"aische Einheit in der materiellen Kultur zeige, und durch eine nachfolgende Phase, die durch eine zunehmende regionale Variabilit\"at gekennzeichnet sei. Jedoch stellt eine ganze Reihe neuer Studien aus den letzten f\"unfzehn Jahren, vor allem solche, die sich auf die exakte Radiokarbondatierung von schnurkeramischen Kontexten konzentrieren, einige der fundamentalen Aspekte dieses bisherigen Modells in Frage. Neue Ergebnisse legen sehr deutlich nahe, dass die verschiedenen Komponenten des A-Horizonts der Schnurkeramik in unterschiedlichen Regionen entstanden, und dass die zuvor behauptete kulturelle Uniformit\"at vielmehr auf das gemeinsame Auftreten einiger spezieller Elemente zur\"uckzuf\"uhren ist, w\"ahrend insgesamt die regionale Variabilit\"at weitaus deutlicher hervortritt als bislang f\"ur alle Phasen der Schnurkeramik angenommen wurde. Hier wird nun eine neue Interpretation vorgeschlagen, die auf der Diversit\"at und regionalen Variabilit\"at der materiellen Kultur und der Bestattungssitten fu\ss t, eine Interpretation, die das Verst\"andnis der Schnurkeramik als Ausdruck einer sozialen Totalit\"at in Frage stellt. Dieses neue Modell argumentiert, dass verschiedene miteinander verkn\"upfte Netzwerke den Durchfluss neuer Praktiken und Symbole in sehr unterschiedliche regionale Kontexte erleichterten. Statt das Ph\"anomen der Schnurkeramik als Ausdruck einer einzigen Identit\"at, Ideologie oder Tradition zu verstehen, mag es zutreffender sein, es als Set von Symbolen und Praktiken zu betrachten, die von lokalen Gruppen selektiv inkorporiert und transformiert wurden; durch diese Vorg\"ange entstand die in den arch\"aologischen Hinterlassenschaften erkennbare Diversit\"at                        ,              RESUMEN                            Destronando la `totalidad': re-evaluando la variabilidad de la cer\'amica cordada en el Neol\'itico Final de Europa, por               Martin Furholt                                         La `cer\'amica cordada' en el centro y este de Europa es un fen\'omeno arqueol\'ogico que ha generado m\'ultiples ideas y mitos sobre los or\'igenes de la lengua indo-europea, las migraciones a gran escala desde las estepas del este y los cambios radicales en la ideolog\'ia despu\'es del 3000               bc               . Estas ideas se han fomentado, en gran medida, por el \'enfasis de sucesivas generaciones de arque\'ologos debido a su extraordinaria expansi\'on geogr\'afica y al patr\'on aparentemente uniforme de la cultura material de la cer\'amica cordada. El modelo tradicional est\'a caracterizado por la presencia de una fase inicial, el denominado horizonte A, que refleja una unidad paneuropea en la cultura material, y una fase posterior caracterizada por un incremento de la variabilidad regional. Sin embargo, en los \'ultimos quince a\~nos, nuevos estudios, especialmente aquellos basados en la dataci\'on rigurosa por radiocarbono de contextos de `Cer\'amica cordada', cuestionan algunos aspectos fundamentales del modelo tradicional. Estos nuevos resultados sugieren que los diferentes componentes del horizonte de la Cer\'amica cordada A emergen en diferentes regiones, y que la uniformidad cultural sostenida inicialmente se debe en realidad a la convergencia de algunos elementos especiales, mientras que la variabilidad regional en todas las fases de la Cer\'amica cordada resulta m\'as evidente de lo que se asum\'ia hasta el momento. Aqu\'i, se propone una nueva interpretaci\'on elaborada a partir de la diversidad y variabilidad regional de la cultura material y de las pr\'acticas funerarias, que cuestiona la visi\'on de la `Cer\'amica cordada' como expresi\'on de una totalidad social. Este nuevo modelo sostiene que diversas redes interconectadas facilitaron el flujo de nuevas pr\'acticas y s\'imbolos en distintos marcos regionales. M\'as que ver el fen\'omeno de la Cer\'amica cordada como reflejo de una identidad, ideolog\'ia o tradici\'on singular, ser\'ia m\'as apropiado considerarlo como un conjunto de s\'imbolos y pr\'acticas que fueron selectivamente incorporadas y transformadas por las sociedades locales, aspecto que dio lugar a la diversidad observada en el registro arqueol\'ogico},

Archaeological excavations of domestic settlements are a recent phenomenon, and the number of excavated sites is still low. Although large-scale excavations of Single Grave Culture settlements took place in the Netherlands in the second half of the 20th century, few results have been published. The project aim to study three of these excavated sites: Keinsmerbrug, Mienakker and Zeewijk. This is the first time that three settlements were studied in its totality by a multidisciplinary team. My PhD research combines technological and functional analysis of Single Grave artefacts (lithic material, the bone and amber implements) from the three selected sites. Tools are understood as the material reflection of the technological development of the prehistoric communities, as well as the carriers of social knowledge and practices. Through the application of these methods it was possible to reconstruct economic practices at the sites and reconstruct subsistence strategies; understand the role played by tools and by sites, and improve the knowledge of the Late Neolithic in Noord-Holland and Europe.},

  abstract = {In this article we present the fragments of a crucible and a possible tuy\`ere that provide evidence of early copper metallurgy in Scandinavia at least 1500 years earlier than previously thought. The technical ceramics were found in a cultural layer containing Early Neolithic Funnel Beaker pottery dating to around 3800\textendash 3500               bc               beneath a long barrow dating to 3300\textendash 3100               bc               . The presence of a copper alloy in the crucible is confirmed by three independent X-ray fluorescence analyses using both a hand-held and a stationary instrument, SEM-EDS analysis of a cross-section, as well as a Bruker Tornado {$\mu$}-X-Ray-fluorescence scanner ({$\mu$}-XRF). The transmission of metallurgy to southern Scandinavia coincided with the introduction of long barrows, causewayed enclosures, two-aisled houses, and certain types of artefacts. Thus, metallurgy seems to be part of the new networks that enabled the establishment of a fully Neolithic society.                        ,                             Dans cet article, les auteurs pr\'esentent neuf fragments appartenant \`a un creuset et les restes de ce qu'ils interpr\`etent comme repr\'esentant une tuy\`ere, ce qui d\'emontrerait l'existence d'une m\'etallurgie du cuivre pr\'ecoce en Scandinavie, quelques 1500 ans avant la date g\'en\'eralement accept\'ee pour son apparition. Les restes de c\'eramique utilis\'ee dans ce processus technique ont \'et\'e d\'ecouverts dans une couche culturelle contenant des tessons de la culture des gobelets en entonnoir (culture TRB) du N\'eolithique ancien (datant autour de 3800\textendash 3500 av. J.-C.) sous un tumulus dat\'e entre 3300 et 3100 av. J.-C. Trois analyses ind\'ependantes par spectrom\'etrie de fluorescence des rayons X confirment la pr\'esence d'un alliage de cuivre dans le creuset : par examen de la fluorescence des rayons X par instruments stationnaires et de poche, en appliquant la m\'ethode SEM-EDS, et par un scanner Bruker Tornado de fluorescence des rayons {$\mu$}-X ({$\mu$}-XRF). L'arriv\'ee de la m\'etallurgie dans le sud de la Scandinavie co\"incide vraisemblablement avec l'\'emergence des tumulus fun\'eraires, des enceintes \`a foss\'es interrompus, des maisons \`a deux trav\'ees et de certains types d'objet. La m\'etallurgie semble donc faire partie des nouveaux r\'eseaux qui ont permis \`a une soci\'et\'e pleinement n\'eolithique de s'enraciner.               Translation by Madeleine Hummler                        ,                             In diesem Artikel beschreiben die Autoren neun Bruchst\"ucke eines Schmelztiegels und eine m\"ogliche Blasd\"use, was darauf schlie\ss en l\"asst, dass die Kupfermetallurgie sehr fr\"uh (mindestens 1500 Jahre fr\"uher als bisher angenommen) in Skandinavien auftauchte. Die Keramik, die dieses technische Verfahren belegen, ist in einer Kulturschicht mit fr\"uhneolithischen Scherben der Trichterbecherkultur (um ca. 3800\textendash 3500 v. Chr.) unter einem langen Grabh\"ugel (der zwischen 3300 und 3100 v.Chr. datiert wird) gefunden worden. Die Anwesenheit einer Kupferlegierung im Schmelztiegel wurde durch drei verschiedene und unabh\"angige R\"ontgenfluoreszenzanalysen best\"atigt: mit einem Handmessger\"at sowie einem konventionellen R\"ontgenfluoreszenzger\"at, durch SEM-EDS Analyse, und auch mithilfe eines Bruker Tornado {$\mu$}-X-Ray-fluorescence ({$\mu$}-XRF) Scanners. Die \"Ubertragung der Metallurgie nach S\"udskandinavien fiel wahrscheinlich mit dem Auftreten von langen Grabh\"ugeln, von Grubenwerken, von zweischiffigen H\"ausern und von bestimmten Typen von Artefakten zusammen. Somit geh\"ort die Metallurgie offenbar zu den neuen Netzwerken, die es erm\"oglichten, eine v\"ollig neolithische Gesellschaft aufzubauen.               Translation by Madeleine Hummler},

It catalyzed the conversion of enzymatically active acetyl-S-citrate lyase into the inactive HS-form and acetate. The enzyme exhibited an optimal rate of inactivation at pH 8.1. Because of the instability of acetyl-S-citrate lyase at acidic and alkaline pH values, all assays were carried out at pH 7.2, where the spontaneous hydrolysis of the acetyl-S-citrate lyase was negligible and deacetylase showed 70\% of the activity at pH 8.1. The apparent Km value for citrate lyase was 10(-7) M at pH 7.2 and 30 C. The activity of the deacetylase was restricted to the citrate lyase from R. gelatinosa. The corresponding lyases from Enterobacter aerogenes (formerly Klebsiella aerogenes) and Streptococcus diacetilactis were not deacetylated; likewise, thioesters such as acetyl-S coenzyme A, acetoacetyl-S coenzyme A, and N-acetyl-S-acetyl-cysteamine were also not hydrolyzed. Citrate lyase deacetylase was present in very small amounts in cells of R. gelatinosa grown with acetate or succinate; it was induced by citrate along with the citrate lyase. L-(+)-Glutamate strongly inhibited the deacetylase. Fifty percent inhibition was obtained at a concentration of 1.4 X 10(-4) L-(+)-glutamate. D-(-)-Glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, L-alpha-hydroxyglutarate, L-(-)-proline, and other metabolites were less effective.},

Guanidine and substituted guanidines react with 2,4-pentanedione to form N-substituted 2-amino-4,6-dimethylpyrimidines at a rate which is lower by at least a factor of 20 than the rate of reaction of 2,4-pentanedione with primary amines. Selective modification of lysine and arginine side chains in proteins can readily be achieved with 2,4-pentanedione. Modification of lysine is favored by reaction at pH 7 or for short reaction times at pH 9. Selective modification of arginine is achieved by reaction with 2,4-pentanedione for long times at pH 9, followed by treatment of the protein with hydroxylamine. The extent of modification of lysine and arginine side chains can readily be measured spectrophotometrically. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 7 results in modification of 3.8 lysine residues and less than 0.4 arginine residue in 24 hr. Modification of lysozyme with 2,4-pentanedione at pH 9 results in modification of 4 lysine residues and 4.5 arginine residues in 100 hr. Treatment of this modified protein with hydroxylamine regenerated the modified lysine residues but caused no change in the modified arginine residues. One arginine residue seems to be essential for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.},

  abstract = {Extremely lavish funeral feasts are common and expensive in many village and chiefdom societies. Anthropologists and politicians often explain such apparently economically irrational expenditures in terms of culture values or traditions. However, viewed from the broader perspective of other types of promotional feasts in transegalitarian or more complex societies (including marriages and house feasts), overtly competitive funeral feasts are used to advertise the success of the surviving family and kin groups. This socioeconomic promotion is important for attracting powerful/successful/wealthy families as affines and allies. Such allies are critical for defending family and individual self-interests in village political and economic struggles that are endemic. Funerals are especially apt contexts for these displays and political manoeuvres.},

Of 987 routine urine specimens, 121 had significant (less than or equal to 10(5) colony-forming units/ml) gram-negative bacilluria, of which 89\% were detected by the Gram stain. Direct rapid identification was correct in 94\%. Results of direct disk-elution antimicrobial tests showed overall agreement with results of standard disk diffusion of 93\% of tests, and major discrepancies in 4\%. For urine specimens with gram-negative bacilluria, this system permitted detection, quantitation, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing in four to six hours with reasonable, though not complete, accuracy.},

  abstract = {The settlement record of the Neolithic of the northern Alpine foreland is used to address the question of what difference having high-resolution chronology \textemdash{} in this case principally provided by dendrochronology \textemdash{} makes to the kinds of narrative we seek to write about the Neolithic. In a search for detailed histories, three kinds of scale are examined. The longer-term development of cultural patterns and boundaries is found to correlate very imprecisely with the character and architecture of settlements. Individual houses and settlements were generally short-lived, suggesting considerable fluidity in social relations at the local level. Greater continuity can be found in the landscape, perhaps involving more than individual communities. We argue that the particular history of the northern Alpine foreland is best understood by interweaving multiple temporal scales, an approach that will need to be extended to other case studies.           ,                             Les donn\'ees fournies par les habitats n\'eolithiques du nord des Alpes sont \`a la base d'une enqu\^ete cherchant \`a \'etablir quelle diff\'erence une chronologie de haute pr\'ecision               \textemdash{}               s'appuyant ici en grande partie sur la dendrochronologie               \textemdash{}               peut-elle faire quand il s'agit d'\'ecrire l'histoire du N\'eolithique. Nous examinons trois types d'\'echelle qui pourraient contribuer \`a produire des r\'ecits plus \'etoff\'es. Le d\'eveloppement sur la longue dur\'ee de tendances et de cadres culturels ne semble correspondre qu'approximativement au caract\`ere et \`a l'architecture des sites d'habitat. En g\'en\'eral les maisons et les habitats individuels \'etaient occup\'es sur de courtes dur\'ees, ce qui indiquerait un large degr\'e de fluidit\'e dans les relations sociales au niveau local. Par contre on observe plus d'\'el\'ements de continuit\'e dans les campagnes environnantes, ce qui sugg\`ererait l'engagement de plusieurs communaut\'es. Nous soutenons que dans le cas du nord de l'arc Alpin l'histoire gagne \`a \^etre appr\'ehend\'ee par l'utilisation de plusieurs \'echelles temporelles mais qu'il faudra \'etendre cette approche \`a d'autres \'etudes de cas.               Translation by Madeleine Hummler.                        ,              Am Beispiel der neolithischen Siedlungen des n\"ordlichen Alpenvorlandes wird dargelegt, welchen Einfluss jahresgenaue Chronologien \textemdash{} in diesem Fall auf dendrochronologischer Basis \textemdash{} auf unsere Interpretationen der neolithischen Gesellschaft haben. Mit dem Ziel, eine detaillierte Vor-Geschichte zu schreiben, werden drei Ebenen beleuchtet. Langzeitentwicklungen kultureller Muster und Grenzen korrelieren nur ungenau mit dem Charakter der Siedlungen und dem Hausbau. H\"auser und Siedlungen waren gew\"ohnlich kurzlebig, was auf betr\"achtliche Flexibilit\"at der sozialen Beziehungen auf lokaler Ebene hinweist. Mehr Kontinuit\"at findet sich in der Landschaft oder Siedlungskammer, wobei hier wahrscheinlich mehr als nur eine Siedlungsgemeinschaft involviert war. Die historische Entwicklung im n\"ordlichen Alpenvorland l\"asst sich allerdings am besten nachzeichnen, wenn die verschiedenen zeitlichen Ebenen miteinander verwoben werden, ein Ansatz, der sich auch auf andere Fallbeispiele ausdehnen l\"asst.},

The base-plate part consisted of a single protein species which cleaved extensively the O-antigen of Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonelly schottmuellerie and with somewhat slower rate that of Salmonella typhi, releasing oligo-saccharide products with rhamnose at the reducing end. Much less cleavage was observed with a strain of S. typhimurium lysogenic for P22, and no significant reaction with Salmonella anatum, Salmonella newington and Salmonella minneapolis. The base-plate part enzyme was a very heat-stable protein and only 10-20\% loss was observed after treatment at 85 degrees C for 5 min. The pH optimum of the enzyme was around 7.5, and the glycosidase activity was not influenced by the ionic strength (25-250 mM( of the medium or the presence of Mg2+. The molecular weight of the base-plate part was 320,000 by sedimentation equilibrium. Dodecylsulphate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single band of molecular weight 77,000, indicating that a single base-plate part corresponds to a tetramer of identical subunits. Circular dichroism spectra of P22 base-plate parts showed a major contribution of beta structure. The protein was rich in acidic amino acids, glycine and serine.},

Test specimens (sample A = 20, sample B = 30 and sample C = 40 \% grog sizes) were prepared and tested using the standard methods. The overall chemical and structural analysis of the raw Nsu clay showed that it is rich in SiO\textsubscript{2} (59.20 wt. \%) and Al\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3} (26.30 wt. \%) with trace amounts of MgO, Fe\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3} and K\textsubscript{2}O, hence an alumino-silicate clay. The refractory properties measured showed acceptable and efficient results. Maximum apparent porosity (20.22 \%) and CCS (61.77 MPa) were obtained at sample B = 30 \% grog size.},

  abstract = {Objectives Inhumations in so-called settlement pits and multiple interments are subordinate burial practices of the Early Bronze Age \'Un\v{e}tice culture in central Germany (2200\textendash 1700/1650 BC). The majority of the \'Un\v{e}tice population was entombed as single inhumations in rectangular grave pits with a normative position of the body. The goal of the study was to test archaeological hypotheses that the deviant burials may represent socially distinct or nonlocal individuals. Materials and Methods The study comprised up to two teeth and one bone each of 74 human individuals from eight sites and faunal comparative samples. The inhumations included regular, deviant burials in so-called settlement or storage pits, and multiple burials. We investigated radiogenic strontium isotope compositions of tooth enamel (87Sr/86Sr) and light stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen of bone collagen ({$\delta$}13C, {$\delta$}15N) aiming at the disclosure of residential changes and dietary patterns. Results Site-specific strontium isotope data ranges mirror different geological properties including calcareous bedrock, loess, and glacial till. Independent from burial types, they disclose low portions of nonlocal individuals of up to some 20\% at the individual sites. The light stable isotope ratios of burials in settlement pits and rectangular graves overlap widely and indicate highly similar dietary habits. Discussion The analytical results let to conclude that inhumations in settlement pits and multiple burials were two of the manifold burial practices of the Early Bronze Age. The selection criteria of the individuals for the different forms of inhumation remained undisclosed. Am J Phys Anthropol 159:496\textendash 516, 2016. \textcopyright{} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The Europe wide spread of what has been called the Bell Beaker phenomenon remains an enigma of European prehistory. While most of the recent research stresses the ideological aspects of using Bell Beaker material culture, here we take a regional and economical perspective. We look for the chronological relationships and the economic choices of the Bell Beaker phase and of its closest neighbours in time and space: the Late Neolithic Corded Ware and the Early Bronze Age. We focus on the regional archaeological settlement history and present the hitherto richest European Bell Beaker-associated collection of palaeobotanical macro-remains, together with our high-resolution palynological work on annually laminated lake sediments. These different lines of evidence are tied together by an absolute chronology derived from new radiocarbon accelerated mass spectrometry (AMS) dates (now more than 200) and from the dendrodates from the World Heritage wet preserved pile dwellings. We show the preceding Late Neolithic, the actual Bell Beaker, and the following Early Bronze age economies each relying on different agricultural strategies that focus on distinct parts of the landscape. There is no link obvious between Late Neolithic and Bell Beaker, but there is between Bell Beaker and Early Bronze Age. Related to different modes of production, differences in ideology become visible in food preferences as well as in other parts of the material culture. We conclude that the Bell Beaker economy represents a re-orientation of the mode of production focusing on single, rather small farmsteads which often do not leave a distinct signal in the archaeological record.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Domestication of horses fundamentally transformed long-range mobility and warfare               1               . However, modern domesticated breeds do not descend from the earliest domestic horse lineage associated with archaeological evidence of bridling, milking and corralling               2\textendash 4               at Botai, Central Asia around 3500               bc               3               . Other longstanding candidate regions for horse domestication, such as Iberia               5               and Anatolia               6               , have also recently~been challenged. Thus, the genetic, geographic and temporal origins of modern domestic horses have remained unknown. Here we pinpoint the Western Eurasian steppes, especially the lower Volga-Don region, as the homeland of modern domestic horses. Furthermore, we map the population changes accompanying domestication from 273 ancient horse genomes. This reveals that modern domestic horses ultimately replaced almost all other local populations as they expanded rapidly across Eurasia from about 2000               bc               , synchronously with equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots. We find that equestrianism involved strong selection for critical locomotor and behavioural adaptations at the               GSDMC               and               ZFPM1               genes. Our results reject the commonly held association               7               between horseback riding and the massive expansion of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists into Europe around 3000               bc               8,9               driving the spread of Indo-European languages               10               . This contrasts with the scenario in Asia where Indo-Iranian languages, chariots and horses spread together, following the early second millennium               bc               Sintashta culture               11,12               .},

  abstract = {A peroperative study of blood flow and flow direction was performed in series of patients with occlusive disease of the subclavian artery. Particular attention was focused on the flow variations caused by arm ischaemia and postischaemic hyperaemia and on the effect of injection of a vasodilator into the distal subclavian artery. The effect on blood flow and flow direction was measured with the aid of an electromagnetic flowmeter. During arm ischaemia induced by an inflated cuff on the arm, the subclavian flow diminished, as did the vertebral artery flow when it was retrograde. If the vertebral artery flow was anterograde, it increased during arm ischaemia. The postischaemic hyperaemia caused an increase of the subclavian flow and of reversed vertebral flow. If the vertebral flow was anterograde, it diminished during the postischaemic hyperaemia. Similar findings were obtained with intra-arterial injection of a vasodilator. The large amount of blood flow passing through the vertebral artery, as well as the flow variations caused by reactive arm hyperaemia, emphasize the role of this artery as a collateral vessel to the upper limb in cases of the subclavian steal phenomenon.},

It summarizes the results of nearly four decades' studies and field explorations and discussions with students on the distribution of plants and animals, practically throughout this vast area and on the underlying factors. A number of specialists in geology, meteorology, botany, zoology, ecology and anthropology have also actively collaborated with me and have contributed valuable chapters in their respective fields. India has an exceptionally rich and highly diversified flora and fauna, exhibiting complex composition, character and affinities. Although the fauna of the Indian region as a whole is less completely known than its flora, we are nevertheless fairly well acquainted with at least the salient features of its faunal characters to enable us to present a meaningful discussion on some of the outstanding peculiarities of the biogeography of India. A general synthesis of the available, though much scattered, information should prove useful to future students of biogeography throughout the world.},

Little attention, however, has been placed on refining or further developing these scales of economic utility. We examine Binford's derivation of the modified general utility index (MGUI) and demonstrate that it is needlessly complex. A nearly identical index, the food utility index (FUI), is presented. It simply scales variation in the amount of meat, marrow, and bone grease associated with different caribou body parts. We then use the insights provided by this simple scale to explore relations among economic utility, differential body-part representation, and human decision making.},

By combining genome-wide data, isotopic evidence, and anthropological and archaeological data, we have gone beyond the dominating supraregional approaches in archaeogenetics to shed light on the complexity of social status, inheritance rules, and mobility during the Bronze Age. We applied a deep microregional approach and analyzed genome-wide data of 104 human individuals deriving from farmstead-related cemeteries from the Late Neolithic to the Middle Bronze Age in southern Germany. Our results reveal individual households, lasting several generations, that consisted of a high-status core family and unrelated low-status individuals; a social organization accompanied by patrilocality and female exogamy; and the stability of this system over 700 years.},

The settlement is dated to 2660\textendash 2470 cal BC and was an agrarian community. Detailed analyses of the material culture combined with biological and pedological parameters allowed new interpretations regarding Corded Ware economies as well as domestic and ritual spheres.

  abstract = {Bell Beaker pottery spread across western and central Europe beginning around 2750 BCE before disappearing between 2200-1800 BCE. The mechanism of its expansion is a topic of long-standing debate, with support for both cultural diffusion and human migration. We present new genome-wide ancient DNA data from 170 Neolithic, Copper Age and Bronze Age Europeans, including 100 Beaker-associated individuals. In contrast to the Corded Ware Complex, which has previously been identified as arriving in central Europe following migration from the east, we observe limited genetic affinity between Iberian and central European Beaker Complex-associated individuals, and thus exclude migration as a significant mechanism of spread between these two regions. However, human migration did have an important role in the further dissemination of the Beaker Complex, which we document most clearly in Britain using data from 80 newly reported individuals dating to 3900-1200 BCE. British Neolithic farmers were genetically similar to contemporary populations in continental Europe and in particular to Neolithic Iberians, suggesting that a portion of the farmer ancestry in Britain came from the Mediterranean rather than the Danubian route of farming expansion. Beginning with the Beaker period, and continuing through the Bronze Age, all British individuals harboured high proportions of Steppe ancestry and were genetically closely related to Beaker-associated individuals from the Lower Rhine area. We use these observations to show that the spread of the Beaker Complex to Britain was mediated by migration from the continent that replaced \&gt;90\% of Britain's Neolithic gene pool within a few hundred years, continuing the process that brought Steppe ancestry into central and northern Europe 400 years earlier.}

  abstract = {We assembled genome-wide data from 271 ancient Iberians, of whom 176 are from the largely unsampled period after 2000 BCE, thereby providing a high-resolution time transect of the Iberian Peninsula. We document high genetic substructure between northwestern and southeastern hunter-gatherers before the spread of farming. We reveal sporadic contacts between Iberia and North Africa by \textasciitilde 2500 BCE and, by \textasciitilde 2000 BCE, the replacement of 40\% of Iberia's ancestry and nearly 100\% of its Y-chromosomes by people with Steppe ancestry. We show that, in the Iron Age, Steppe ancestry had spread not only into Indo-European\textendash speaking regions but also into non-Indo-European\textendash speaking ones, and we reveal that present-day Basques are best described as a typical Iron Age population without the admixture events that later affected the rest of Iberia. Additionally, we document how, beginning at least in the Roman period, the ancestry of the peninsula was transformed by gene flow from North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.},

We here present the results of stable isotope and radiocarbon measurements together with reference 14C dates on grave goods from terrestrial animals such as tooth pendants found in 10 of the graves. Age differences between human individuals and their associated grave goods are used to calculate 14C reservoir effects. The resulting substantial reservoir effects have revealed misleadingly high 14C ages of their remains, which originally indicated a surprisingly early occurrence of graves and long-term use of this Neolithic burial site. We demonstrate that in order to 14C date the human bones from Ostorf cemetery, it is of utmost importance to distinguish between terrestrial- and freshwater-influenced diet. The latter may result in significantly higher than marine reservoir ages with apparent 14C ages up to \textasciitilde 800 yr too old. The carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition may provide a basis for or an indicator of necessary corrections of dates on humans where no datable grave goods of terrestrial origin such as tooth pendants or tusks are available. Based on the associated age control animals, there is no evidence that the dated earliest burials occurred any earlier than 3300 BC, in contrast to the original first impression of the grave site (\textasciitilde 3800 BC).},

Studying 271 human genomes dated \textasciitilde 4900 to 1600 BCE from the European heartland, Bohemia, we reveal unprecedented genetic changes and social processes. Major migrations preceded the arrival of ``steppe'' ancestry, and at \textasciitilde 2800 BCE, three genetically and culturally differentiated groups coexisted. Corded Ware appeared by 2900 BCE, were initially genetically diverse, did not derive all steppe ancestry from known Yamnaya, and assimilated females of diverse backgrounds. Both Corded Ware and Bell Beaker groups underwent dynamic changes, involving sharp reductions and complete replacements of Y-chromosomal diversity at \textasciitilde 2600 and \textasciitilde 2400 BCE, respectively, the latter accompanied by increased Neolithic-like ancestry. The Bronze Age saw new social organization emerge amid a {$\geq$}40\% population turnover.},

This paper reviews these more ancient logboats, which were discovered in the beds of former or still existing lakes and rivers and present new radiocarbon (               14               C) dates and wood taxa identifications. Special attention is paid to the logboat found at \v{S}ventoji 58, which is at present the oldest               14               C-dated (2895\textendash 2640 cal BC) logboat found East of the Baltic Sea. Most logboats from the pre-1800s period were               14               C dated to medieval and early modern periods and they were made out of pine and oak wood. From a very scarce dataset available it seems that oak wood was introduced into logboat building by Neolithic people, who also brought new technologies in stone tool production. We also noted that               14               C dating does not confirm the logboat typology suggested in earlier studies.},

During this seminal \'epoque, cultural and social formations of an entirely new kind and magnitude came to characterize Europe. The intense and dynamic relations between local and large-scale change processes coincided with increased mobility in different domains and forms, forging new identities and shaping the emergence of Europe as a distinct cultural zone. Through over fifty essays by leading Bronze Age scholars, the reader engages with cultural mobility and connectivity and the ways in which these forces affected and transformed human behaviour},

Here, we report the oldest direct evidence of Yersinia pestis identified by ancient DNA in human teeth from Asia and Europe dating from 2,800 to 5,000 years ago. By sequencing the genomes, we find that these ancient plague strains are basal to all known Yersinia pestis. We find the origins of the Yersinia pestis lineage to be at least two times older than previous estimates. We also identify a temporal sequence of~genetic changes that lead to increased virulence~and the emergence of the bubonic plague. Our results show that plague infection was endemic in the human populations of Eurasia at least 3,000 years before any historical recordings of pandemics.},

  abstract = {The extensive use of mollusc shell as a versatile raw material is testament to its importance in prehistoric times. The consistent choice of certain species for different purposes, including the making of ornaments, is a direct representation of how humans viewed and exploited their environment. The necessary taxonomic information, however, is often impossible to obtain from objects that are small, heavily worked or degraded. Here we propose a novel biogeochemical approach to track the biological origin of prehistoric mollusc shell. We conducted an in-depth study of archaeological ornaments using microstructural, geochemical and biomolecular analyses, including `palaeoshellomics', the first application of palaeoproteomics to mollusc shells (and indeed to any invertebrate calcified tissue). We reveal the consistent use of locally-sourced freshwater mother-of-pearl for the standardized manufacture of `double-buttons'. This craft is found throughout Europe between 4200\textendash 3800 BCE, highlighting the ornament-makers' profound knowledge of the biogeosphere and the existence of cross-cultural traditions.           ,              Just like people do today, prehistoric humans liked to adorn themselves with beautiful objects. Shells, from creatures like clams and snails, were used to decorate clothing or worn as jewelry at least as far back as 100,000 years ago. Later people used shells as the raw materials to make beads or bracelets. Learning where the shells came from may help scientists understand why prehistoric people chose certain shells and not others. It may also offer clues about how they used natural resources and the cultural significance of these objects. But identifying the shells is difficult because they lose many of their original distinctive features when worked into ornaments.             New tools that use DNA or proteins to identify the raw materials used to craft ancient artifacts have emerged that may help. So far, scientists have mostly used these genomic and proteomic tools to identify the source of materials made from animal hide, ivory or bone \textendash{} where collagen is the most abundant protein molecule. Yet it is more challenging to extract and characterize proteins or genetic material from mollusc shells. This is partly because the amount of proteins in shells is at least 300 times lower than in bone, and also because the makeup of proteins in shells is not as well-known as in collagen.             Sakalauskaite et al. have now overcome these issues by combining the analytical tools used to study the proteins and mineral content of modern shells with those of ancient protein research. They then used this approach, which they named palaeoshellomics, to extract proteins from seven ``double-buttons'' \textendash{} pearl-like ornaments crafted by prehistoric people in Europe. The double-buttons were made between 4200 and 3800 BC and found at archeological sites in Denmark, Germany and Romania. Comparing the extracted proteins to those from various mollusc shells showed that the double-buttons were made from freshwater mussels belonging to a group known as the Unionoida.             The discovery helps settle a decade-long debate in archeology about the origin of the shells used to make double-buttons in prehistoric Europe. Ancient people often crafted ornaments from marine shells, because they were exotic and considered more prestigious. But the results on the double-buttons suggest instead that mother-of-pearl from fresh water shells was valued and used by groups throughout Europe, even those living in coastal areas. The palaeoshellomics technique used by Sakalauskaite et al. may now help identify the origins of shells from archeological and palaeontological sites.},

  abstract = {The authors of this article consider the relationship in European prehistory between the procurement of high-quality stones (for axeheads, daggers, and other tools) on the one hand, and the early mining, crafting, and deposition of copper on the other. The data consist of radiocarbon dates for the exploitation of stone quarries, flint mines, and copper mines, and of information regarding the frequency through time of jade axeheads and copper artefacts. By adopting a broad perspective, spanning much of central-western Europe from 5500 to 2000               bc               , they identify a general pattern in which the circulation of the first copper artefacts was associated with a decline in specialized stone quarrying. The latter re-emerged in certain regions when copper use decreased, before declining more permanently in the Bell Beaker phase, once copper became more generally available. Regional variations reflect the degrees of connectivity among overlapping copper exchange networks. The patterns revealed are in keeping with previous understandings, refine them through quantification and demonstrate their cyclical nature, with additional reference to likely local demographic trajectories.                        ,                             Cet article concerne les relations entre l'acquisition de pierre de haute qualit\'e (utilis\'ee dans la production de haches, de poignards et d'autres outils) et l'exploitation du cuivre, l'artisanat et les d\'ep\^ots d'objets en cuivre en Europe pr\'ehistorique. Il se base sur les dates radiocarbone obtenues pour les carri\`eres de pierre, de silex et mines de cuivre et sur les donn\'ees relatives \`a la fr\'equence des haches de jade et objets de cuivre \`a travers les \'epoques. Les auteurs adoptent une vaste perspective couvrant l'Europe centre-occidentale entre 5500 et 2000 av. J.-C et identifient une tendance g\'en\'erale dans laquelle la circulation des premiers objets en cuivre est associ\'ee \`a un d\'eclin de l'exploitation sp\'ecialis\'ee des carri\`eres de pierre. Cette derni\`ere r\'eapparut dans certaines r\'egions lorsque l'usage du cuivre diminua, puis d\'ecrut de fa\c{c}on plus permanente pendant la phase campaniforme, quand le cuivre devint plus accessible. Les diff\'erences entre r\'egions refl\`etent le niveau des rapports entre r\'eseaux interconnect\'es. Les r\'esultats de cette \'etude s'accordent avec les interpr\'etations ant\'erieures mais vont au-del\`a en quantifiant les donn\'ees et en d\'emontrant leur caract\`ere cyclique, compl\'ement\'ees par certaines sources relatives \`a un profil d\'emographique local.               Translation by Madeleine Hummler                        ,                             Dieser Artikel betrifft die Beziehungen zwischen der Besorgung von hochwertigen Stein- und Silexprodukten (z. B. Beile, Dolche und andere Werkzeuge) und der fr\"uhen Gewinnung von Kupfer im Bergbau, im Handwerk und in der Niederlegung von Kupfergegenst\"anden in Europa w\"ahrend der Urgeschichte. Die Daten bestehen aus Radiokarbonbestimmungen aus Steinbr\"uchen, Silexbergbaust\"atten und Kupferminen sowie Hinweise auf die H\"aufigkeit und zeitliche Verteilung von Jadebeilen und Kupferartefakten. In einer weiten Sichtweise, welche die meisten Gegenden in West- und Mitteleuropa zwischen 5500 und 2000 v. Chr. umfasst, identifizieren die Autoren eine allgemeine Tendenz, wobei die Verbreitung der ersten Kupferartefakten mit dem R\"uckgang des spezialisierten Steinbergbaus vergesellschaftet ist. Letzterer tauchte wieder in gewissen Gegenden auf, als die Nutzung von Kupfer abnahm; er fiel in der Glockenbecherzeit dauerhafter ab, als Kupfer allgemein zug\"anglich wurde. Regionale Unterschiede widerspiegeln die Intensit\"at der Wechselbeziehungen zwischen \"uberschneidenden Austauschnetzwerken von Kupfer. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchung reflektieren fr\"uhere Deutungen, verbessern sie aber durch Quantifizierung und illustrieren den zyklischen Charakter der Stein- und Kupfergewinnung, mit zus\"atzlichen Hinweisen auf m\"oglichen lokalen demografischen Entwicklungen.

  abstract = {We present a high-resolution cross-disciplinary analysis of kinship structure and social institutions in two Late Copper Age Bell Beaker culture cemeteries of South Germany containing 24 and 18 burials, of which 34 provided genetic information. By combining archaeological, anthropological, genetic and isotopic evidence we are able to document the internal kinship and residency structure of the cemeteries and the socially organizing principles of these local communities. The buried individuals represent four to six generations of two family groups, one nuclear family at the Alburg cemetery, and one seemingly more extended at Irlbach. While likely monogamous, they practiced exogamy, as six out of eight non-locals are women. Maternal genetic diversity is high with 23 different mitochondrial haplotypes from 34 individuals, whereas all males belong to one single Y-chromosome haplogroup without any detectable contribution from Y-chromosomes typical of the farmers who had been the sole inhabitants of the region hundreds of years before. This provides evidence for the society being patrilocal, perhaps as a way of protecting property among the male line, while in-marriage from many different places secured social and political networks and prevented inbreeding. We also find evidence that the communities practiced selection for which of their children (aged 0\textendash 14 years) received a proper burial, as buried juveniles were in all but one case boys, suggesting the priority of young males in the cemeteries. This is plausibly linked to the exchange of foster children as part of an expansionist kinship system which is well attested from later Indo-European-speaking cultural groups.},

Pulmonary function testing has revealed no further significant deterioration at long-term follow-up (17 months). After oxygen therapy was initiated, arterial carbon dioxide tension increased slightly, but decreased to pretreatment levels when patients were allowed to breathe room air. The electrocardiogram, which was unchanged at one month, has shown some reversal of cor pulmonale in five patients. Six patients have died, yielding a 56 percent survival rate at two-and-one-half years by the life table analysis. Five patients were autopsied, with possible oxygen toxicity being present in only one. The quality of life in our patients was improved and was especially represented by a reduction in hospital admissions for respiratory illness. We believe that continuous oxygen therapy is beneficial and worthwhile economically in certain patients.},

(2) Among 18,587 medical inpatients, there were 34 patients admitted for BMD in the absence of neoplasia or prior cytotoxic drug therapy; one of the latter reported using chlorpromazine hydrochloride, but it is doubtful whether this drug was the cause of the BMD.

  abstract = {This article presents a typological and physical metallurgy analysis of copper artifacts found in child grave (no 7) at the Lublin-Volhynian culture cemetery in Ksi\k{a}\.znice (Lesser Poland). The burial, dating to approx. 4050\textendash 3940 BC, contains a rich set of copper jewellery: a massive earring, small earring, bracelet - made of copper wire, and two beads made of a rolled piece of metal sheet. As part of metallographic analysis of metal finds from grave 7, site 2 in Ksi\k{a}\.znice, quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted, regarding chemistry and microstructure of all the five artifacts. In the artifacts tested, there were identified the elements significant from the perspective of raw material origin and smelting technology: arsenic, antimony, silver, tin, zinc, lead, bismuth, cobalt, nickel and iron. The highest total content of impurities was noted for the bracelet. Against the background of other elements, the arsenic content stands out here and it is 2.1\%, and lead 0.26\%. For the remaining artifacts, the arsenic content was 0{$\div$}0,24\%, and lead 0{$\div$}0,039\%. Antimony (0.098\%) and zinc (0.15\%) was only recorded for the one of the bead. Also, the highest content of silver (0.05\%) was established in this case. In the remaining ornaments, the silver content was below 0.02\%. Based on the X-ray fluorescent spectroscopy results, chemical profiles were established for the individual, and they were ascribed to raw material groups according to R. Krause: 1) pure copper, 2) arsenic copper and 3) antimony copper (Krause 2003: 90\textendash 91, Abb. 40\textendash 41). The presented inventory of copper artifacts from grave 7, having many analogies in the Carpathian Basin and the areas to the north and east of the Carpathians, confirms the thesis about wide, trans-Carpathian contacts of the group which was using the necropolis in Ksi\k{a}\.znice at the turn of 5th and 4th millennium BC.},

Combined archaeological and genetic evidence supports widespread Early Bronze Age population movements out of the Pontic\textendash Caspian steppe that resulted in gene flow across vast distances, linking populations of Yamnaya pastoralists in Scandinavia with pastoral populations (known as the Afanasievo) far to the east in the Altai Mountains               1,2               and Mongolia               3               . Although some models hold that this expansion was the outcome of a newly mobile pastoral economy characterized by horse traction, bulk wagon transport               4\textendash 6               and regular dietary dependence on meat and milk               5               , hard evidence for these economic features has not been found. Here we draw on proteomic analysis of dental calculus from individuals from the western Eurasian steppe to demonstrate a major transition in dairying at the start of the Bronze Age. The rapid onset of ubiquitous dairying at a point in time when steppe populations are known to have begun dispersing offers critical insight into a key catalyst of steppe mobility. The identification of horse milk proteins also indicates horse domestication by the Early Bronze Age, which provides support for its role in steppe dispersals. Our results point to a potential epicentre for horse domestication in the Pontic\textendash Caspian steppe by the third millennium               bc               , and offer strong support for the notion that the novel exploitation of secondary animal products was a key driver of the expansions of Eurasian steppe pastoralists by the Early Bronze Age.},
