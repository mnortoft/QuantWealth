  Quantifying wealth in prehistoric graves is a long-standing unresolved issue. Previous approaches have either focused on only one or a few aspects of grave wealth or grave good value, e.g. scarcity, or total number of object types (TOT), thus neglecting other value aspects, or, if combining value parameters, not in a reproducible or transparent way which makes application or comparison with other cases difficult. This study presents a new method of combining different aspects of grave good wealth from value aspects such as manufacturing time and skill, case-specific scarcity, prestige, and raw material distance value measures, as well as estimated meat consumption from animal bones, all equally weighted and combined with applied Gini index. This Gini index can then be combined with Gini indices from more general grave wealth measures, including TOT and grave pit depth to form a more balanced Gini index of general grave wealth. All of these parameters are calculated in a flexible and semi-automated framework based on experimental and prehistoric crafts reference data, which can be continuously updated and fine-tuned, flexibly integrates the respective chaînes operatoires, and which is openly available. As a case study, the framework was applied to a dataset of 81 graves from 46 sites of the Corded Ware Culture in Moravia, Czech Republic.

# Introduction
Wealth may be defined in different ways in a given society, and may have varying focus in different economies, regions and periods. A general framework for characterizing main wealth types based on a comparative analysis of ethnographic data has been proposed by @mulder_etal09 and @smith_etal10, summarized in @smith_etal18. This includes embodied wealth (e.g. body weight, grip strength, practical skills, and reproductive success), relational wealth (social ties in food-sharing networks and other types of assistance), and material wealth (land, livestock, and house and household goods). 

The Gini coefficient, which summarizes inequality in a population as a single number between 0 (100% equal) and 1 (100% unequal) based on income, has been a popular tool in modern populations because of its simplicity and because it can be compared across countries around the world [e.g. by @unitednations21]. However, income data are not available for prehistoric populations, and thus, different proxy-measures have been utilized to calculate Gini coefficients. These include grave goods, domestic artefacts, house floor area, and storage sizes [see @smith_etal18 for an overview of studies]. 

Another measure for modern populations, the Human Development Index (HDI), combines income, life expectancy, and education in order to measure human development in a way that can be compared across countries. @oka_etal18, inspired by the HDI, proposed a Composite Archaeological Inequality (CAI) index to combine inequality measures based on different material sources and across historical and archaeological sample populations, also with the purpose of comparing populations of different economies. 

Grave good wealth is particularly difficult to quantify as perceived object value may vary considerably between populations and periods and is unknown to us from prehistoric materials. Some studies attempt quantification by grave good plurality [@hedeager92; @mittnik_etal19; @nieszery_etal95; @szmyt02], referred to as Total number of Object Types (TOT) in this study. However, this treats each object with equal value, no matter the material or count, which may skew grave wealth distributions [@nieszery_etal95: 205]. Ethnographic [e.g. @dalton77; @olausson83b: 12-14] and archaeological studies [@grossmann21; @nieszery_etal95; @todorova02] do mention some overlapping grave good value parameters, such as scarcity, manufacturing hours, distance to raw materials, required manufacturing skill, and exaggerated shapes, which can be quantified to some extent. However, in quantification studies, the focus has usually been on one parameter (e.g. scarcity) or, when combined in point systems, transparency for each value point is lacking (see SI: section 2) for more detail on this). This makes cross-study comparison difficult. The present study attempts to combine multiple value and wealth parameters (including TOT) in a transparent and reproducible way, and introduces a additional case-specific 'prestige' value measure derived from the median of the TOT range for each object category. As a case study, these measures are applied to grave data from the Moravian Corded Ware Culture.

The size of a grave pit may reflect status [e.g. @grossmann21], and this can be measured using volume, area or depth (the bottom of the grave in this study). However, both area and volume are likely affected by body size, and thus unrelated to status or wealth. Large grave goods (e.g. large pots) may also affect the grave pit area and volume while smaller items (e.g. metals) may have been more valuable. Grave depth should be less affected by body size [@bosel08: 51], and it is therefore used here as an additional measure of status.

# Source Critical Considerations
Using graves as a direct and universal measure of grave wealth is not straightforward. While there may be correlations between, e.g. metal-bearing or polished stone-bearing graves and more protein or nutrition intake from high trophic food such as meat and dairy reflected in $\delta^{15}$N and $\delta ^{13}$C stable isotopes [@budd_etal20; @masclanslatorre_etal20], a universal association between high trophic diet metal-bearing grave goods is still uncertain. 

Even when taking grave goods at face value, it is uncertain whether they reflect the material wealth of the individual in life or material household wealth transmitted by next of kin at the burial, or perhaps even by the whole community in which case it may rather reflect social status and relational wealth. Thus material wealth and social status (and relational wealth) in a community are difficult to disentangle. However, use-wear studies of grave goods have shown that it may be possible to see if an object has been freshly manufactured (no or little use-wear), perhaps specifically as a grave good, or used or worn for a long time before the burial [@frinculeasa_etal20; @masclanslatorre_etal20] by the individual or those adding their used belongings in the grave. The former could indicate lived material wealth, and the latter could indicate transmitted affectionate value. However, the grave goods in this study have not been studied in such detail, and social status and material wealth are therefore not distinguished in this study. 

Organic remains (apart from skeletal material) such as textiles are very laborious to make and may have reflected important symbology and status, but are rarely preserved. If females expressed status or wealth more through textiles than males did, a male bias would appear in terms of gendered wealth and status. Some funerary rituals, potentially conveying considerable meaning and status, are also difficult to reconstruct, except for, the sprinkling of red ochre or funeral feasting, possibly indicated by animal bones in the graves. The latter is included here as estimated usable meat of whole animals in kg (by meat utility indices and minimal number of individuals (MNI)), including scarcity and prestige bonus (SI: section 5). Grave disturbance also adds uncertainty to the interpretation of burials [cf. @kolar12]. 


# Case Study
With the rise of ancient genomics, it is now clear that the 3rd millennium BCE saw a major male-driven population influx from the Pontic-Caspian steppe/forest-steppe to Central and Northern Europe [@papac_etal21; @scorrano_etal21], although not on horseback [@librado_etal21], perhaps due to a population increase from intensified herding on the steppe in the late 4th millennium BCE [@wilkin_etal21]. This new influx of people correlates extraordinarily well with the linguistic 'steppe-hypothesis' of Indo-European language dispersal [@anthony17; @anthony_brown17; @anthony_ringe15; @chang_etal15], including borrowing agricultural vocabulary from Neolithic farmers [@iversen_kroonen17]. Recent archaeogenomic studies have shown that Corded Ware (CWC) and Bell Beaker (BBC) societies of the 3rd millennium BCE tend to have been patrilinear, and practicing female exogamy [@mittnik_etal19; @papac_etal21; @sjogren_etal20], also supported by reconstructed Indo-European kinship vocabulary [@olsen19; @sjogren_etal20]. A non-random decrease in Y-haplogroup diversity from early to late CWC in Bohemia, and elsewhere, during the early 3rd millennium BCE may also reflect competition between male lineages or 'an isolated mating network with strictly exclusive social norms' [@papac_etal21: 6; @zeng_etal18]. 

The CWC has been interpreted as relatively mobile with a mixed agriculture and herding and gathering economy [@lechterbeck_etal13], and more focused on the individual and the core family than the preceding agricultural societies [@harrison_heyd07; @kristiansen_etal17: 343]. CWC burial rituals are associated with burials under mounds in clear gender differentiation, reflected in body position (males lying on their right side, females on their left side) and in grave goods (males with battle-axes, females with ornaments) [@iversen15: 135, 166; @wiermann02]. However, exceptions to this pattern occur [@furholt14a], and males generally show more supra-regional patterns than females [@bourgeois_kroon17; @olerud21].  

Moravian CWC radiocarbon dates, while still relatively few in number, indicate a later occupation around 2600-2000 cal BCE than in other areas of Europe, thus overlapping with the Moravian BBC (2500-2000 cal BCE) and Proto-Unětice cultures (c. 2450-1900/1700 cal BCE) [@kolar18: 43-44].
Due to the lack of large cemeteries and available radiocarbon dates, the data in this study is spread over several hundred years and several different sites, and therefore do not represent one coherent community, which limits the power of conclusions made here. 

Moravian CWC residential areas are absent (and generally rare across the CWC) [@kolar18: 142], and thus this analysis focuses on graves. For comparison, a house area Gini index was instead produced combining CWC houses from different regions (see below). Unlike northwestern CWC, Moravian (and other Central European) CWC graves have metals [at least 13%, @kolar18: Table 13]. However, less than 0.1% of CWC graves are interpreted as metallurgist graves (by metal-working tools), while Bell Beaker metallurgist graves are less than 1% [@peska16: 2:4]. 
The Morava river likely kept the CWC community connected with metal producers around the Upper Danube, the Carpathian Basin, the Balkans, and possibly the steppe [@kolar18: 189]. Moravian CWC metals have not been provenanced by lead isotope studies, but may have come from the Špania Dolina copper mine in Central Slovakia (about 200 km) and perhaps the Northeastern Alpine foothills [@kolar18: 170]. Gold may have come from the Aries river in the Apuseni Mountains in Romania (about 700 km away, only one gold hair-decoration in this study, grave 155.1.4) where roughly contemporary alluvial gold sources have been identified [@cristea-stan_constantinescu16]. Many burial mounds in Moravia were poorly excavated and documented before World War II or destroyed by modern agriculture [@kolar18: 58, 79, 90] which makes it difficult to use mound size (or the presence or absence of mounds) as a wealth-proxy.

## Materials and Methods
All analyses were done in `r R.version.string` [@rcoreteam21] via RStudio [@rstudioteam20], with the tidyverse package [@wickham_etal19] for data manipulation. Graphics were produced using the ggplot2 package [@wickham16], the Lorenz curve ggplot add-on [@chen_cortina20], PCA with FactoMineR @le_etal08 for which missing grave depth values using imputed with the missMDA package [@josse_husson16], see colophon in Appendix for a list of all packages used. Grave and grave good data for 82 Moravian individuals in 81 graves from 46 sites were collected from the catalogues by @kolar11 and @sebela_rakovsky99. Gini indices were calculated using the DescTools package [@andrietmult_al_21], with confidence interval settings set to accelerated bias-corrected ('bca'), 4000 bootstrap replicates, and 80% confidence level following @oka_etal18. 

In order to calculate grave good value, five different value parameters were defined: manufacturing time (in person-hours (PH), see SI: section 4 for details), prestige/symbolic value (median of TOT range for each grave good category), scarcity (total number of graves / graves with that material as in @grossmann21, using the overall Moravian CWC numbers from Kolar [-@kolar18: Table 13], SI: 3.3), travel hours for imported objects (assuming an average speed of 7 km/h, SI: 3.2), and a separate measure of skill bonus as percentage of PH in four different levels (low=0.0, medium=0.4, high=2.0, very high=5.0, and a hypothetical expert=10.0, for exceptional artefacts requiring >10 years of focused training to make), SI: 3.1. 
Estimated consumption of animal meat at the burial, assumed here to reflect feasting [@hayden09], was calculated from the MNI of animal bones (assuming bones represent whole animals slaughtered), including scarcity bonus of animal bones and prestige bonus (SI: section 5). 

All these measures may reflect some aspect of grave good value, and were therefore normalized to give them equal weight, and the sum of all six (incl. animal meat) for each grave was used as a measure of _overall grave good value_. 
Three different Gini coefficients were computed on the grave data which were used as basis for the CAI: combined grave good value, TOT, and grave depth (unimputed), see Figure \@ref(fig:lorenz-plots). 

Only single graves with preserved skeletal materials were used [except for one double grave, Iv4_807A/B, where the grave goods were listed separately, @kolar11], such that grave goods could be connected to the individual with reasonable likelihood (see Figure \@ref(fig:cwc-moravia-map)). Grave disturbance cannot be ruled out for some of these graves and remains a caveat, see SI: 6.1 for more detail.

Objects in the infill occurred in 8 graves adding some uncertainty to the data. However, the differences between including and excluding grave fill objects were minute for the PCA and  grave good Gini indices, see SI: 6.2.

The value of time in prehistory is uncertain, but food production in the Neolithic may have occupied at least 5 hours per day throughout the year, and available artefact manufacturing time may have been somewhat limited by daylight hours [@kerig07, see also SI: 1.1], except perhaps for very simple repetitive work such as making numerous shell beads (SI: 4.6). Thus, manufacturing time may have had some limited value. Even so, making accurate and general estimates of manufacturing time of prehistoric artefacts is extremely difficult because a myriad of factors affect the end result and the time used, not least the speed and methods of the person doing the work and how it is documented (for a more detailed discussion on this 'it depends'-dilemma, see @petty19). Therefore, any time estimates used in this study are crude approximations at best and would ideally have been done through several years of data collection and controlled experiments which would be entirely beyond the scope of this study, (see SI: section 1). However, it is hoped that the transparency of this framework takes the initial steps towards continuous collection and improvement of such data. Since manufacturing time accounts for just 1/5 (2/5 incl. skill) of the overall grave good value, and 1/8 (2/8 incl. skill) of all grave wealth measures, inaccuracies should not affect the overall results significantly. 

In order to set up a relatively flexible computation system for grave good manufacturing time (using PH), the data were, partly based on the table structure in @kolar11, divided into the main materials: Groundstone (SI: 4.3), flint (SI: 4.2, subdivided into flint axes and other flint), Osseous artefacts (SI: 4.5), shell ornaments (SI: 4.6), metals (SI 4.4), ceramics (SI: 4.1, subdivided into pots and other), and animal bones (SI: 5). This was done for both the archaeological data and for the reference data from experimental, ethnographic and prehistoric crafts people sources. The time estimates from the reference data thus form the basis of the time estimates for the archaeological data based on a number of parameters within the _chaîne operatoire_ of each artefact. As an example for pottery vessels (based on an interview with the historical potter Inger Heebøl at Lejre Land of Legends), size is a major (and easily quantifiable) criterion of shaping time and skill. The largest single measure of the pot's dimension gave the best correlation with time, even for different potters (SI: 4.1.1), and requires the least from the archaeological data quality. Apart from pot size, percentage surface cover of impressed decoration, plastic decoration, polish, smoothing/beating, type and amount of temper, slip/paint (where relevant), and firing were also used as separate factors on the time estimate, usually together with size. However, a minimum time for the smallest and most simple pots was indicated by the reference data, and applied to the archaeological data. See SI: 4.1 for full details. 

Flint and stone axes/adzes and daggers were divided into extraction, blank-knapping, preform-knapping, grinding, sharpening, and wooden handle (presuming these were hafted). Skill bonus based on knapping and grinding time was added for axes/adzes longer than 30 cm (not relevant for Moravian CWC) and thickness below 2 cm, and with extraordinary polish or shine inspired by @olausson83b: 12-13 (see SI: 4.2). 

Time for groundstone tools was initially calculated based on Mohs hardness and fracture toughness, primarily from Pétrequin [-@petrequin_etal12] on Neolithic Alpine axes. However, when later adding experimental data for battle axes and thin-butted groundstone axes from Olausson [-@olausson83a], there was no correlation with these factors at all (many different combinations were tested), and Olausson ( _ibid._) demonstrates that stone tools can be made much faster than usually estimated. Therefore, the time medians were used for Alpine axes vs. other groundstone axes (e.g. battle axes) respectively, but including hardness and toughness as minor factors (SI: 4.3). This underlines that the experimental study design, methods, and documentation are critical caveats for reported manufacturing times. More systematic experimental data, beyond the scope of this study, may correlate better with hardness and toughness.

CWC metals were usually simple copper ornaments and tools shaped from wire or sheet [@kolar18], and in the 3rd millennium most copper ornaments generally seem to have been shaped by cold-forging (e.g. hammering and rolling) with frequent annealing in-between [@fregni14: 130]. The whole _chaîne operatoire_ was divided, following @brinkmann19, into mining, ore beneficiation, smelting, forging from raw nugget state (but mould manufacture, melting, and casting for cast objects), production/maintenance of metallurgical tools, and post-processing such as grinding, polishing, and, for cast metals, also removing excess metal ('jet') (SI: 4.4). 

The system thus takes the detailed description of the archaeological artefacts for each material into account using separate material-specific data tables and scripts which flow into a final script adding all of the PH calculations into one final table (see SI: 6, and total result in Appendix Table \@ref(tab:raw-data-table)). A simplified graph of the whole manufacturing structure is given in Figure \@ref(fig:labour-hour-graph).

## Analyses and Results

Different grave good value aspects: manufacturing time and skill, were calculated for the 82 individuals based on the reference data from experimental, ethnographic and craft people sources. The calculated results for each material were merged, see Table \@ref(tab:raw-data-table). Distance to raw material and frequency of each material within the study area were added to the material-specific tables and used to calculate import travel hours and scarcity. 

Separately, the TOT measure (presence/absence for each grave good category, in this case spanning 0-10 represented categories from 'poorest' to 'richest', was calculated and used as basis for a separate Gini index, and for the prestige measure. Figure \@ref(fig:TOT-plot) shows a boxplot of the different TOT ranges for each grave good category including the median. This indicates that some categories are exclusive to the upper half of the spectrum (score in parentheses): gold hair decoration (10), shell (7.5) and tooth beads (6.5), stone axes (6), copper awls/needles (6.5), and copper knives/razors (5). Ceramic pots span the whole TOT spectrum but cluster in the lower half (3 and 4, probably reflecting the general population's TOT distribution). Battle-axes surprisingly cluster below the middle of the spectrum (4) and the single spindle whorl is positioned at the lower end (3). While some shell and tooth beads were locally available, the fact that they are exclusive to the upper TOT spectrum, is also supported by a wider study of CWC ornaments [@kysely_etal19]. Thus, the 'prestige' measure gives a separate aspect of grave good value from scarcity distinguishing shell and tooth beads from spindle whorls although they are both rare in this case. 

```{r TOT-plot, fig.cap="Association of each grave good type with TOT."}
TOT_prestige_plot
```

The medians mentioned above were applied as 'prestige' values instead of the raw grave good counts, then summed for each grave, and added to the other grave good value parameters in one final grave good table (Table \@ref(tab:raw-data-table)). All grave good value parameters (manufacturing time, skill, import travel hours, scarcity, prestige, and meat consumption) were normalized, and the sum of these values was calculated for each grave. A Gini index was then calculated for the normalized sum. 
A separate Gini index was also calculated from grave depths as reported in the catalogues (excluding graves that were too damaged to determine this). 

Principal components analysis of the eight grave wealth measures as active variables (and materials as passive variables) was applied to the graves (excluding the extreme outlier graves 177.1.1 and 155.1.4), with the measures (blue arrows) graded by their percentage contribution to PC1 and PC2 (Figure \@ref(fig:value-PCA)). The individuals form three groups: Group 1 is low on all measures, Group 2 is intermediate on artefacts of high value, but high in (estimated) meat expenditure (along PC2, ~14% of the variation), and Group 3 is high on grave artefacts (along PC1, ~60% of variation) but mostly low on meat expenditure (PC2). Grave depth is weak on PC1 and PC2, but dominates PC3 (accounting only for ~10% of overall variation, Figure \@ref(fig:scree-plots)). All measures have significant positive correlation along PC1 (P=5.110e-35 to 1.450e-02), but PH, prestige, TOT, scarcity, skill, and travel (in that order, P=5.110e-35 to 6.838e-17) have higher significance than grave depth (P=2.409e-09) and meat (P=1.450e-02). Conversely on PC2, only meat has highly significant _positive_ correlation (P=1.724e-26) and somewhat flint (P=5.180e-03, two of four flint axes in graves with high meat), and then TOT (P=1.713e-02) and prestige (P= 2.157e-02, perhaps an artefact of both including animal bone presence) while grave depth (P=3.169e-03), metal (P=1.038e-02), and travel (P=1.694e-02) have less, but still significant, _negative_ correlation. When comparing this with material groups, (estimated) meat expenditure and flint artefacts (negatively correlated with imported artefacts such as metals) in funerals may reflect a more local expression of wealth or status than artefact value measures and grave depth. The three groups could be interpreted as a lower tier of society, an upper tier with prestige goods and exclusive access to exotic materials, and a middle tier with less access to prestige and exotic goods, but with livestock to spare (unless borrowed from people of the upper tier). It may be hypothesized that the middle tier attempted to gain importance and form alliances with the upper tier by organizing feasts at e.g. their family funerals as described in Hayden [-@hayden09].

Combining all aspects of grave wealth gives three different measures: TOT, grave depth, and combined grave good value (including meat consumption). 

The Gini coefficients and Lorenz curves for the 82 Moravian CWC individuals in this dataset are given in Table \@ref(tab:grave-gini-table) and Figure \@ref(fig:lorenz-plots) along with scarcity for comparison with @grossmann21. The Lorenz curve plots the percentage distribution of the sample population on the x-axis and the accumulated percentage of the given wealth measure on the y-axis ordered from the poorest to the richest graves. Grossmann [-@grossmann21: 87] gets a grave good scarcity Gini index of 0.69 for Lauda-Königshofen (Southern Central German CWC 2600-2500 BCE). A scarcity Gini of `r Gini_scarcity[1]` for Moravian CWC is quite close to this, although both values are very high compared to CWC house size Gini indices (see below).

To get an approximate baseline, Gini indices from house area data over different periods and regions of Central and Northern Europe were calculated using data from various contributions in @risch_etal19 (CWC), Globular Amphora Culture (GAC), Unětice, and other Middle, Late and Final Neolithic cultures (Scand MN and FN_CA)), @balfanz_etal15 and @conrad_etal18 (BBC), @schmalfuss_etal18 (Lausitz culture), @garciadiaz17, @sorensen15, and @sparrevohn_etal19 (Scandinavian Neolithic (EN, MN) and CWC).

The house area Gini indices (x10^2^, lower line) and mean of areas over time (upper line) are given in Figure \@ref(fig:house-gini) and in Table \@ref(tab:house-gini-table). The Gini index is designed for income ranges which are generally much higher than the smallest houses (or rather huts) in this study. Therefore, Gini indices became very high for GAC (36.9) and FN_CA (35.2) because they have very low and small ranges. This only affected higher ranges slightly (e.g. CWC from 29.9 to 27.0). To diminish the effect of this artefact, the lower bar was increased by adding 10 m^2^ to all house sizes before computing the Gini (house sizes given in this paper are still the original numbers). The adjusted Gini indices now all give a value ranging from 10's to early 20's, the GAC and FN_CA decreasing the most. CWC has `r gini_house_CWC_single`, higher than any other group. 

The grave CAI index, for the TOT Gini, grave depth Gini, and combined grave good Gini is `r CAI_normed`. Fochesato et al. [-@fochesato_etal19; -@fochesato_etal21] found that grave Ginis tend to be higher per individual than per household (i.e. hypothetical couples) across case studies, and that individual Ginis in graves should thus be corrected by a ratio of 0.91-0.92. On that background, the mean (0.915) ratio is applied in this study giving a household-adjusted grave CAI of `r CAI_couple_adj`. The difference between house and grave CAI is still quite high at `r round(abs(((gini_house_CWC_single/CAI_couple_adj)-1)*100), 1)`%. If we accept that the 'true Gini' approximation lies somewhere between the Gini for house sizes and the CAI from graves, we may again apply the CAI to these two values which gives a combined house and grave CAI of `r CAI_house_grave`. Alternatively, we could use the arithmetic mean of the two which is `r mean(c(gini_house_CWC_single, CAI_couple_adj))`, in both cases placing the Moravian CWC inequality measure generally in the low 30's. 


# Discussion
Fochesato et al. [-@fochesato_etal19: 13-15 and Table S5], based on four cases with both graves and houses (Late Neolithic Balkans, and Early Dynastic Mesopotamia), find a general difference between grave good and house size Ginis of 0.244-0.343 (or an average of 28.1%) for which they downgrade the grave Gini to match the house Gini. However, all four cases are agricultural (some even state) societies, and this relationship could differ depending on the social norms and economy of a given society. Furthermore, making house sizes the gold standard of the expected Gini level, may be misleading, due to houses/huts without wooden posts (tents, small huts, etc.) being archaeologically invisible or difficult to measure. 

A similar argument can be made for missing parts of the population in grave data which could have been at the lower tier of society or slaves. Fochesato et al. [-@fochesato_etal19: Table S4] reconstruct the missing population in Southern Mesopotamia to be 34% and in Roman (rural?) Italy to be 9%. Both of these are state societies, and presumably much more dependent on institutionalized slave labour than expected for Neolithic societies. If we accept the association of Indo-European language with 'steppe' ancestry dispersal, we may also get an indication of how institutionalized slavery was in steppe-derived populations such as the CWC by looking at reconstructed 'Core-Indo-European' (Proto-Indo-European excluding the Anatolian branch) vocabulary of slavery. While such vocabulary is widespread in the daughter languages, and while military, conquering activities, and looting vocabulary is easier to reconstruct, it seems difficult to reconstruct a word specifically meaning 'slave' or 'servant' [@campanile98a: 16-17; @author17: 84-89]. Therefore, we might not expect a large proportion of missing 'unfree' in pre-Bronze Age steppe-derived cultures, probably less than 9% (Roman Italy), and the impact of slaves on the Gini index may be limited. However, it is still uncertain if only the upper tier of society were buried in a way that leaves traces today, potentially leaving a large 'missing' population, e.g. due to taboo, 'sky' burials, shallow graves destroyed by the plough or children's bones disintegrating faster [@kolar18: 68, 101]. 
The author instead follows Fochesato et al. [-@fochesato_etal21: 3] in not correcting for a missing population, because the data has graves without grave goods. 

This study suggests using the CAI for houses and graves together instead of downgrading grave Ginis by a fixed 28.1%. This acknowledges extreme grave wealth inequalities while still downplaying generally exaggerated grave wealth Ginis towards house Ginis. In future cases with only a Gini for houses, or only a CAI for graves, we could perhaps extrapolate from this example that the grave CAI is overestimated from the _combined house+grave CAI_ by `r grave_exaggeration`, and house Ginis are underestimated by `r house_underestimate` Gini points. We could thus adjust the respective Gini indices accordingly for comparison between case studies. However, more case studies should be done to determine the reliability of this difference. The relatively small adjustments to the Gini or CAI may seem insignificant, but the combined measure is more data-driven, transparent, and includes several aspects that seem to define wealth in ethnographic studies (e.g. @bosel08, @dalton77; @olausson83b), thus more applicable and comparable between different cases.

Importantly, applying the different measures to PCA and clustering combined with material groups in the PCA also reveal a new social structure consistent with a lower social tier (`r group1`%), an upper tier (`r group3`%) with long-distance connections (including metal), and a hitherto unknown middle social tier (`r group2`%) not part of the long distance networks, but with higher funerary meat expenditure, perhaps using funerary feasts to attract the upper social tier to form new alliances, or to gain more influence on, or distinguish themselves from, the lower tier. Thus, these groups may show mechanisms of vertical social mobility in the CWC. Whether this pattern is present in other regions of the CWC will need further study. Other interpretations of this intermediate group cannot be ruled out at this point. They may simply have a more herding-based economy than the other groups that they express during funerals, thus rather reflecting a heterarchy than a hierarchy, or they may simply have other ideals of what should be deposited in the grave that do not relate to either subsistence or wealth. These questions will be explored further in future studies from other regions with better documentation, and where more bioarchaeological data is available (including possible family structures). The important point is that quantifying grave wealth in this way takes these questions beyond the hypothetical, and towards something that may be tested in the future with more and better data.
